### Simons Genome Diversity Project

A diverse dataset of Whole-genome sequencing reads from 301 individuals from 146 countries to highlight genetic variants not found in datasets made with genotyping arrays.

[TODO] Find out what each file is. I know that `ERP010710_metadata.tsv` contains reference alignments and variant calling files. `PRJEB9586_metadata.tsv` contains fastq reads. But the former has 555 lines, and the later 398, so I can't infer whether it is one-to-one.
