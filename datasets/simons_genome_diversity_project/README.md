The table containing download links on the ENA website may be missing some cells (no value, N/A, etc.), and unfortunately if you download the table, then you might not have links for the samples you want. We suspect it might be because the website pre-filters the data shown. In any case, it worked for us to get the original file through `curl` using the columns we want. Look at [PRJEB9586's columns](RodrioData/datasets/simons_genome_diversity_project/study_PRJEB9586/PRJEB9586_metadata.tsv) for an example.  we want.
